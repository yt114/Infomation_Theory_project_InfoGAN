# Infomation_Theory_project_InfoGAN

This is for my information theory STA 563 project of which goal is to present papers related to the mutual information.

The final submission is the poster.

The code is adopted from https://github.com/znxlwm/pytorch-generative-model-collections.

The key issues in my opinion is the prior estimation of distribution Q. Simply assumes it as Gaussian may satisfy small dataset but not scale to large complex dataset.
